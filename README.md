# App.js
 
# Overview

I created a MadLibs website story using Javascript as the back-end language.

I created this program to better understand Javascript. It has always been interesting to me how people create so many things on webpages, and I wanted to know a little about how they did those things. I wanted to expand my knowledge about the world of programming and of web development. Even though I don't plan on going into that field of work, it is good to know a little of what web developers do.

Here is a video demo of my project.

# Development Environment

To create this program, I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

I used Javascript as the language to create this program. I used a little bit of JQuery to add an animation to the program.

# Useful Websites

Here are a list of websites that I used to learn Javascript while I was making the program.

- [W3Schools.com (Javascript)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
- [W3Schools.com (JQuery)](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)
- [JavascriptTutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/)

# Future Work

Here are some things that I want to continue working on in the future:

- Something that I would like to add to this program is the ability to resubmit new words after having gone through once.
- I would like to continue learning Javascript so that I could one day create my own web portfolio.
- I would also like to figure out a more efficient way to create this program. I feel that my code isn't the best way to create a program such as this.
